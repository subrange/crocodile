croc is going to be

- vars: idents like x, result
- assignments: var = expression;
- types: int/bool inferred from suffix

no functions, control flow, blocks, pointers, arrays, etc.

5i, true, false
+, -, *, /, <, >, ==, &&, ||
(x + y) * z

the lex should create

{ TOKEN_INT_LITERAL, "5i", 1, 0 }

generate C
